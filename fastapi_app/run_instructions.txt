# Instructions to Run the FastAPI Project

1. **Ensure Docker is Installed**: Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. **Open Terminal**: Navigate to the project directory where the Dockerfile is located.

3. **Build the Docker Image**: Run the following command to build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t fastapi_app .
   ```

4. **Run the Docker Container**: After the image is built, run the container using:
   ```
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 fastapi_app
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to access the FastAPI application.

6. **Stopping the Container**: To stop the running container, you can use:
   ```
   docker ps  # to find the container ID
   docker stop <container_id>
   ```

7. **Optional - Using Docker Compose**: If you have a `docker-compose.yml` file, you can also run the application using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

Make sure to follow these steps to successfully run your FastAPI project.
